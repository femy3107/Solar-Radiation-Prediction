Solar Radiation Prediction Analysis
The dataset contains such columns as: "wind direction", "wind speed", "humidity" and temperature. The response parameter that is to be predicted is: "Solar_radiation". It contains measurements for the past 4 months and you have to predict the level of solar radiation. Just imagine that you've got solar energy batteries and you want to know will it be reasonable to use them in future?

About this file These datasets are meteorological data from the HI-SEAS weather station from four months (September through December 2016) between Mission IV and Mission V.

For each dataset, the fields are:

A row number (1-n) useful in sorting this export's results The UNIX time_t date (seconds since Jan 1, 1970). Useful in sorting this export's results with other export's results The date in yyyy-mm-dd format The local time of day in hh:mm:ss 24-hour format The numeric data, if any (may be an empty string) The text data, if any (may be an empty string)

The units of each dataset are:

Solar radiation: watts per meter^2

Temperature: degrees Fahrenheit

Humidity: percent

Barometric pressure: Hg

Wind direction: degrees

Wind speed: miles per hour

Sunrise/sunset: Hawaii time
